## Clickers

Doing clicker questions using JupyterBook is very seamless for students!

One can use any of the web-based options that exist. 

Some examples I have used before are:

- [sli.do](https://sli.do)
- [Poll Everywhere](https://pollev.com)
- [TypeForm](https://typeform)
- [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com)

There are many others, most should work if they have some sort of web interface.

In general, here are the steps to do this:

1. Create your poll as you would
2. Grab the embed URL from the website (see {numref}`figure-slido`)
3. Paste it into a jupyter notebook file as a markdown cell or as an IFrame

## Short Quiz

You may imagine giving students a short comprehension quiz after they watch a video to make sure they grasped the finer points of the lesson.
You can also embed quizzes directly into your JupyterBook so it's a seamless experience for the students. 
Here we will use Qualtrics, but other options are also possible!

The example quiz with automatic scoring below is from the [University of Michigan Qualtrics wiki](http://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/qualtrics/index.php/Example_Surveys)!

#### Making quizzes on Qualtrics

Qualtrics has some [extremely good resources](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/scoring/) on creating quizzes and automatically scoring them. 
There are sophisticated options for creating quizzes, I encourage you to check it out. 
At UBC and UBCO, we have an institutional license to Qualtrics, so you can even ask students to authenticate via CWL and collect student identification information.
In other words - if used correctly - this is fully FIPPA compliant!

Here's the qualtrics survey embedded in the IFrame.

## Quiz IN a video

Scenario B is pretty good, but it's still a bit clunky as the quiz and the video are separated.
That is often a desired feature, especially if students want to come back and re-visit the quiz after thinking about the video. 

Sometimes though, it would be good to pause the video and ask students one or several clicker-type questions, and give them some feedback.

This is where the Kaltura Video Service (and a few others) can help facilitate these types of interactions.
